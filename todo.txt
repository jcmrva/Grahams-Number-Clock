# number matching game

- scoring

user-configurable, number of elements factored in

score counter on top of the screen? option?

elements:
    - time between first and last selections (motor skill, memory)
        low > high, but not zero if 1 occurrance
    - time started after number last displayed (memory)
        high > low
    - time between last selection and number next displayed (memory)
        low > high
    - occurrances of the chosen number (memory)
        high > low
    - grid proximity (memory, motor skill)
        sparse (high) > dense (low)
    - number of occurrances selected (memory, motor skill)
        all > 1, if none then unscored
    - assist: can't select non-matching numbers once first is chosen (motor skill)
        off > on


don't make the user feel mocked or pitied for changing the scoring
weights probably won't change

selecting a number starts the round
round ends when the selected number rolls around
if all selections are de-selected, round is reset/cancelled


- UI

standard timekeep is block highlight

option 1:
    when game mode is on, time switches to border highlight
    mouseover number is solid highlight
    click fill animation?
    conceptually, blocks waiting to be filled
    pro: visible change from normal mode, time updates might be less distracting
    con: 

option 2:
    time remains block highlight
    mouseover number is border highlight
    click fill animation?
    selected blocks are a different shade than normal
    if overlap, favor selection
    pro: time highlights consistent with normal, 
    con: border highlight might be less clear about target
