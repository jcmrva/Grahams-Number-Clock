# number matching game

- gameplay basics

game mode can be switched on/off
selecting a number starts the round
round ends when the first selected number returns (seconds)
scorekeeping stops when the round ends
changing a scoring option cancels the round
if all selections are de-selected (toggled), round is cancelled
when a round ends, all selections are reset
if game mode is toggled off, round is cancelled
no pausing (can't pause time, duh)
clock resolution @ ? (lower) ms during game mode only?

- scoring

user-configurable, number of elements factored in (10 max)

elements:
    - time (ms) between first and last selections (motor skill, memory)
        low > high, but not zero if 1 occurrance
    - time started after number last displayed (memory)
        high > low
        moderate
    - time between last selection and number next displayed (memory)
        low > high
    - occurrances of the chosen number (memory)
        high > low
    - grid proximity (memory, motor skill)
        sparse (high) > dense (low)
    - number of occurrances selected (memory, motor skill)
        all > 1, if none then unscored
    - assist: can't select non-matching numbers once first is chosen (motor skill)
        off > on
        moderate
    - assist: #selected/#possible UI hint (memory)
        off > on
        minor
    - count of invalid selections (motor skill)
        0 > max
        auto-disabled if select assist is turned on
        log or exp? i.e. 1 is ok-ish but more mistakes = harsher penalties
        retain fractional penalty if invalid selection is de-selected?

some un-togglable elements?
    - field size (high > low)
    - HHMM matching hidden (low) or not (high)
      not hidden could be an advantage if the selected number is MM
      penalty for that?

should feel fair regardless of element combination
don't make the user feel mocked or pitied for changing the scoring
weights probably won't change if some are turned off
weight percent, factor, ?

weight emphasis:
    it's more important to select everything than to be fast
    and not make invalid selections

examples:
    15 has 2 occurrances, close together
    16 has 8 occurrances, spread apart
    7 has 1 occurrance
    selecting the 7 right after it appears results in a very low score
    selecting the 7 just before it appears results in a higher score,
        but still near the low end of the scale
    selecting all 16s shortly before they appear results in a much higher score
        than both 15s, but not if invalid selections are made
        even if the assist is used on 15 but not 16


- UI

reset button?
score counter on top of the screen? option?
auto-hide HHMM matching? or only on small format displays?
option to view score breakdown at round's end? (clears on next round)

standard timekeeping is block highlight

invalid selections (if allowed) obviously incorrect (color/pattern)

option 1:
    when game mode is on, time (seconds) switches to border highlight
    mouseover number is solid highlight
    selected blocks are a different shade than normal?
    click fill animation?
    conceptually, blocks waiting to be filled
    pro: visible change from normal mode, time updates might be less distracting
    con: 

option 2:
    time remains block highlight
    mouseover number is border highlight
    click fill animation?
    selected blocks are a different shade than normal
    if overlap, favor selection
    pro: time highlights consistent with normal
    con: border highlight might be less clear about target

option 3:
    time remains block highlight
    first selection switches time to border highlight
    round cancellation resets to block
    otherwise as option 1

- extras

sound effects?
daily high score table saved on something like Firebase?
 eligible only if (max - 2)+ scoring elements turned on?
