[**Graham's Number**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number), a number so large the observable universe couldn't hypothetically be adapted to contain it, was devised by mathematician Ronald Graham to explain the upper bound of a problem he was working on. Rather than just being inscrutably gigantic and only describable through notation, it's possible to [calculate the last digits](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/733/calculate-the-last-digits-of-grahams-number) (but not the first).

The **Graham's Number Clock** highlights the viewer's current hour, minute, and second values within the last 500 digits of Graham's Number. That's it... for now.
